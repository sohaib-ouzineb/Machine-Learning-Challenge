# Machine-Learning-Challenge
In this challenge, we are faced with the following task : given two faces and their similarity scores, tell whether these are the same faces or not with the best accuracy possible. We use different technics from Neural Networks, SVMs to ensemble methods like stacking, random forests and bagging.
